Hi guys,

I know it is a pretty old post, but I get the solution, so if anybody also runs into that problem, he will get the solution too.

When the error appears, it is related with a certain package which info is corrupted in the dpkg database. In my situation, I get the following :

(Reading database ... 55%dpkg: unrecoverable fatal error, aborting:
failed in buffer_read(fd): files list for package `kde-icons-oxygen': Input/output error
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)

So the solution is the following :

1. Go into the /var/lib/dpkg directory
2. Make a backup of the "status" file
3. Edit the "status" file
4. Search the package that gave the error
5. Just delete the lines from this package (but let all other lines that concern other packages even if they contains the broken package in their "Replaces" or "Depends" fields)

Personally, here are the lines that I deleted :

Package: kde-icons-oxygen

6. Save changes in the "status" file
7. Run: sudo dpkg dpkg --configure -a
8. Force the reinstallation of missing dependencies (because now, there are some) : sudo apt-get -f install
I think that if the broken package does not depend on any other package (could be rare), just reinstall it : sudo apt-get install the_package
9. Everything is fine now can update, upgrade, or install new packages !

Hope this will help someone !
Cheers,
Gartss
